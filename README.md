## About
Jumping Jack is a game developed in JAVA, using JAVA Swing and AWT packages for a window-based GUI. 
The rules of the game are simple. The central character, Jack, is trapped in a castle on fire and has to jump over walls in order to escape.
The movement of Jack is very similar to that of birds in the popular game, Flappy Birds.


## How does it work?
The window-based GUI is created with the help of the JAVA Swing and AWT packages.
On startup, a menu is displayed which begins a new game upon a mouse click.
The game creates new instances of both the jumper and the walls it must jump over.
The gaps between walls are randomly generated and if the jumper hits any of the walls, he dies.
An appropriate death message is displayed.


## Technologies Used
